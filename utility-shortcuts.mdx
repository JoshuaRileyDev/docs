title: 'Utility Shortcuts'
description: ''
---

During the development of Wingman Pro, we encountered a significant limitation: **each custom action could only run for a maximum of 30 seconds**. This constraint became particularly challenging when executing routines that utilize features like Inject.

To overcome this limitation, we developed a set of utility shortcuts. These specialized shortcuts can be easily dragged and dropped into other shortcuts using the Run Shortcut action, allowing for greater flexibility and functionality.

This solution implements what we call "modular programming" - a powerful approach that enables you to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components. With this method, you can:

- Combine larger lists of actions into single, reusable shortcuts
- Incorporate these modular shortcuts into other shortcuts
- Maximize efficiency through code reuse
- Bypass the 30-second limitation effectively

This modular approach not only solves the technical constraints but also promotes better code organization and reusability across your shortcuts.

## WMP Return Input

This action allows you to return a value to the Wingman app.

You can use this to return a value to the Wingman app, which can then be used by other shortcuts.
