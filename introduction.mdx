Wingman Pro is an app developed by Joshua Riley and Mark Lemon. It's been over a year in development and it's essentially a toolkit for iOS shortcuts that allow you to program your own effects using iOS shortcuts.  And it has well over 50 actions that are created for the magic industry that allow you to do things that have never before been possible with iOS shortcuts.

One of the unique features of Wingman Pro is the input system. So we have a bunch of input methods that you can use which have never been used before within iOS shortcuts natively, such as the lock screen input or Bluetooth swipes or even using a Bluetooth remote.
