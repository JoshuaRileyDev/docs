This action allows you to use the volume buttons on your iPhone to trigger actions within your shortcut.

When you enable the trigger volume input within your shortcut, it will switch to the Wingman app's perform mode. You can then use either your volume up or down button to interact with the shortcut.

The input returned will be either "up" or "down," depending on which button you press.

Finally, you'll need to use the WMP return input shortcut to poll for these changes, which will return either "up" or "down" accordingly.
